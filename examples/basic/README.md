Basic integration example

## Getting Started

1. `npm i`
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm run start`

## Usage

Currently the example uses a setTimeout to run the initial scan.

This is set since the first time the "@a11ywatch/a11ywatch" is imported it will initite the suite.

In order to have it ready at runtime `import "@a11ywatch/a11ywatch"` at the top location of your application.
